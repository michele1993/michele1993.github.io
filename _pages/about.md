Ciao!

I am a visiting Postdoctoral Research Associate in Neuroscience and Machine Learning in the <a href='https://neuralml.github.io'>Neural & Machine Larning Group</a> at the University of Oxford (UK).
I did my PhD in Machine Learning and Neuroscience at the University of Bristol under the supervison of Laurence Aitchison (primary), Casimir Ludwig and Nathan Lepora. 

Previously, I obtained a master of research in Cognitive Neuroscience at UCL and I undertook contract education in Data Science and Knowledge Engineering at the University of Maastricht.

**Research interests**

My research focuses on applying (deep) reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to neuroscience, with two primary areas of emphasis.
First, I explore how policy gradient methods can help our understanding of human motor learning.
Second, I investigate human cognitive planning by leveraging latent planning models from the RL literature.
Additionally, during my PhD, I worked on (purely) deep RL projects focused on improving value estimation in Actor-Critic algorithms.

More broadly, I'm interested in how machine learning and computational models can provide a framework to better understand the vast neural and behavioral data in neuroscience.
