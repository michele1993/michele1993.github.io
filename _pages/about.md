Ciao!

I am a visiting Postdoctoral Research Associate in Neuroscience and Machine Learning at the University of Oxford (UK) in the <a href='https://neuralml.github.io'>Neural & Machine Larning Group</a>.
I did my PhD in Machine Learning and Neuroscience at the University of Bristol under the supervison of Laurence Aitchison (primary), Casimir Ludwig and Nathan Lepora. 

Previously, I obtained a master of research in Cognitive Neuroscience at UCL and I undertook contract education in Data Science and Knowledge Engineering at the University of Maastricht.

**Research interests**

My research interest focuses on applications of (deep) reinforcement learning (RL) to neuroscience. 
This interest led me towards two main research directions. 
The first one involes developing policy gradients methods to understanding human motor learning. 
The second one involves investigating human cognitive planning through the lenses of latent planning models in the RL literature.
During my PhD, I also worked on purely deep RL projects on improving value estimation in Actor-Critic algorithms.
