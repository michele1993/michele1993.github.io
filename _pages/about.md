Hello,
I am a final year PhD student in Machine Learning and Neuroscience at the University of Bristol (UK). My main research interest revolves around reinforcement learning (RL), in particular model-based policy gradient approaches. This interest initially led me to work at the intersection of Reinforcement Learning and human motor control. However, lately, my focus has shifted towards more theoretical RL projects.

Previously, I obtained a master of research in Cognitive Neuroscience at UCL and I undertook contract education in Data Science and Knowledge Engineering at the University of Maastricht. There, I also undertook an internship in deep RL.
